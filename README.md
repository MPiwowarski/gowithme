Description:

GoWithMe is an application created in ASP.NET WebForms technology. 
It is used to create or search for rides offers. The concept is similar to the famous blablacar.com website.

For example, one guy is going from London to Edinburgh on date 23-03-2018. There are 4 empty sits in his car, so he can
take a few people with him. Of course not for free, e.g. Â£20 for one sit.
In this portal, you can mainly:

a). Create your own ride offer so you can optimize the costs of the travel as you will have to spent less money on fuel or

b). you can search for ride offers from place A to place B. This way you can save money as in general, this kind of transport is much cheaper than the public one.
